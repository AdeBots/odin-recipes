    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Arayes is one of those things that will have you wondering, “why didn’t I think of that?” Well, I did, sort of. I
        vaguely remember that a long time ago, probably very late in the evening, I made a cheeseburger by stuffing a
        pita, and pan-frying it to a perfect, crispy golden-brown. Or, at least that’s how I assume it came out, but
        anyway, that exercise was mostly about soaking up alcohol, whereas this is about sharing what I think might
        become your new favorite sandwich.</p>
    <p>These really were great made as shown, but of course, this type of technique begs for customization. Any ground
        meat, along with any spices and seasonings will work out just about the same, as long as you don’t overstuff. We
        want the filling to be cooked through at the same time our pita bread is golden-brown and crispy. The same goes
        for what sauce to serve with these, although I thought the tahini yogurt was a perfect pairing. But, no matter
        how you adjust, Arayes need to be added to your hot sandwich rotation, which is why I really do hope you give
        them a try soon. Enjoy!</p>
